1. ./run.sh shell script compiles and runs our program with all of the necessary compilation flags along
with passing energy_prices.txt onto the command line.
2. Their is a local copy of our database that we used called comp3400database.db. It has already been built using sqlite3 and the sql files in sql_commands
3. There is menu in the terminal that will greet you with various options. Simply enter the number and press enter. (Except for 33 that is a sub-menu option for option 3)
4. The menu will continue to loop until you exit.
5. There is a customers.output file that is produced by our program containing all the customer entries
that were loaded into our program from the database at runtime. It would also reflect additions/deletions of customers that happened during runtime.
