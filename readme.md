1. ./run.sh compiles and runs the cpp program. There is an argument of the Command Line that is the text file containing the prices of the different types of energy that are used for calculating customer bills.
2. You will be greeted with many customer and bill objects being instantiated and inserted into 
unordered maps for later use. Examples of such uses are lookup to check the infomation of a customer,
editing a customers info, etc.
3. After this there will be a text menu displaying all the options. To go to check out an option simply enter the number and press enter. The text menu will then loop and the process repeats again.
4. There is an option to enter a special file with a .input extension containing the information of customers to insert into data structures that will store them for the duration of the running process.
5. When you exit, there will be a customers.output file that will contain all the information of the customers
that were inserted into the customers map during the running of the program.
